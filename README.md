## Quick Start

1. clone repo

2. install dependencies & set up backend / fronend

    Prerequisites

    - **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
    - **Python** (3.10 or higher)
    - **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for containerized setup)
    - **uv** (Python package manager)



    Tutorial on setup backend:

    [backend set up guide](/backend/README.md)

    Tutorial on setup frontend:

    [frontend setup guide](/frontend/README.md)

3. run locally in cli

It is recommended to run frontend and backend separatly in cli
before building images, as images takes longer to build.

4. build & run images via docker compose

```python
docker compose up
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1

To re-build backend images

```python
docker compose build backend
```

5. deploy

[deploy for free with cloud providers](/docs/deploy.md)

### API Code Generation

The project uses OpenAPI for automatic client generation:

```bash
# Generate OpenAPI spec and TypeScript client
make api
```

This command:
1. Generates `openapi.json` in the frontend root based on backend type hints
2. Creates TypeScript SDK in `frontend/src/client/sdk.gen.ts`

### Port Configuration

#### Default Ports

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Base Path**: `/api/v{API_VERSION}` (default: `/api/v1`)

#### Changing Ports

**Frontend Port (Vite)**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --port 4000
```

**Backend Port**:
```bash
cd backend
# For local development
uv run python -m src.main --port 9000

# Or modify docker-compose.yml for Docker setup
```

**Docker Compose Port Mapping**:
Edit `docker-compose.yml` to change port mappings:
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    ports:
      - "4000:80"  # Change 3000 to your desired port
  backend: 
    ports:
      - "9000:8000"  # Change 8000 to your desired port
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**:
```bash
# Check which process is using the port
lsof -i :3000  # or :8000 for backend

# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use different ports as described in Port Configuration section
```

**Database Connection Issues**:
- Ensure your database is running (if using custom database)
- Check your `settings.toml` configuration
- For Supabase, verify your URL and API keys are correct
- Default setup uses SQLite (`test.db`) - no additional setup required

**API Generation Fails**:

```bash
# Ensure backend is running first
cd backend

# Then generate API in a new terminal
make api

cd frontend

make api
```

**Frontend Build Errors**:
```bash
cd frontend
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Docker Issues**:
```bash
# Reset Docker environment
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

### Development Tips

- Always run `make api` after backend changes that affect API endpoints
- Use `docker compose down -v` to reset Docker volumes if needed
- Check `backend/test.db` file permissions if using SQLite locally
- Frontend hot-reload works automatically with Vite
- Backend auto-reload is enabled in development mode
- The backend uses SQLite by default, so no external database setup is required for development
